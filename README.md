Memory-Allocator
================

Intro
------

 This Project demonstrates how allocation of processes happen in memory using algorithms:

        1- first fit
        2- best fit
    

Contents
--------
- memory allocator.exe : an executable file of the allocator which requires input data and genetrates a simulation of memory with the allocated processes                     
- Form1.cs : this file contains the backend of the project with all the algorithms' implementations 
- memory.cs : this file is just a new form where the memory is being created
- Tips.cs : this file is just a new form which shows how to use the program
